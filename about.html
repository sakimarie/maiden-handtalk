				<h1>About</h1>
	
				
				<h2>Purpose:  To discuss Jordan’s idea of Maiden Handtalk and linguistics of signed languages.</h2>
					<p>Focus questions: <br> 
					Is MHT a language or a code?<br>
					How does MHT compare to our American equivalent, ASL or native American sign ?<br>
					Objectives:  <br>
					Attendees will be able to recall information about 
					Panel talking points	 <br>
					What is sign language <br>
					American Sign Language <br>
					Non-universal<br>
					Based on French Sign Language <br>
					Native American Sign Language <br>
				Used as a universal language between tribes and by the deaf<br></p>
					
					
					<h2>Linguistics</h2>
					<p>Sign language linguistics is a newer field without a lot of readily available research <br>
					Phonology<br>
					There are no sounds, it should be a silent language<br>
					There are hand shapes, movements, and positions in ASL <br>
					Mom and dad - handshape, positioning <br>
					Can and now - movement<br>
					Train and sit - handshape<br>
					Morphology<br>
					Prefixes and suffixes?<br>
					Pluralizing?<br>
					Syntax<br>
					Probably close to ASL grammar.  It’s simple.  Topic + Comment<br>
					Semantics?<br>
					Pragmatics<br>
					“I have toh” is the first thing learned by all Maidens.  
					Language registers?<br>
					Probably only an informal register, since the language is mostly for secret communications between sisters
					What is MHT?<br>
					RJ created for Aiel shieldmaidens.<br>
					He didn’t really write a whole lot down about it specifically in his notes<br>
					Secret, only known by Maidens<br>
					Based on Native American Sign Language<br>
					What do we know about it from the books?<br>
					“Flashing fingers” etc<br>
					Wiggling pinky finger indicates sarcasm<br>
					First thing they learn is “I have toh”<br>
					What can we assume?<br>
					It was developed initially to aid in combat, but Maidens took it the extra step to turn it into a more complex system<br>
					Was it?  What are the audience thoughts?<br>
					Fingerspelling is probably phonetic rather than alphabetical<br>
					Do Maidens do a lot of reading?<br>
					Preference for one-handed signs<br>
					They have to hold weapons in the other often<br>
					Slow, steady pace to prevent excess noise from clapping, snapping etc<br>
					American Sign Language Lesson<br>
					Grammar <br>
					Time + topic + comment<br>
					Adjectives often come after the noun <br>
					Shield maiden words<br>
					Run, walk, eat, drink, water, shade, honor, obligation, servant, war, fight, sister,</p>
