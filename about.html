				<h1>About</h1>
				<h2>A little bit about me</h2>
				
				<p>Purpose:  To discuss Jordan’s idea of Maiden Handtalk and linguistics of signed languages.
					Focus questions:  
					Is MHT a language or a code?
					How does MHT compare to our American equivalent, ASL or native American sign ?
					Objectives:  
					Attendees will be able to recall information about 
					Panel talking points	
					What is sign language
					American Sign Language
					Non-universal
					Based on French Sign Language 
					Native American Sign Language
					Used as a universal language between tribes and by the deaf
					
					
					Linguistics
					Sign language linguistics is a newer field without a lot of readily available research 
					Phonology
					There are no sounds, it should be a silent language
					There are hand shapes, movements, and positions in ASL 
					Mom and dad - handshape, positioning 
					Can and now - movement
					Train and sit - handshape
					Morphology
					Prefixes and suffixes?
					Pluralizing?
					Syntax
					Probably close to ASL grammar.  It’s simple.  Topic + Comment
					Semantics?
					Pragmatics
					“I have toh” is the first thing learned by all Maidens.  
					Language registers?
					Probably only an informal register, since the language is mostly for secret communications between sisters
					What is MHT?
					RJ created for Aiel shieldmaidens.
					He didn’t really write a whole lot down about it specifically in his notes
					Secret, only known by Maidens
					Based on Native American Sign Language
					What do we know about it from the books?
					“Flashing fingers” etc
					Wiggling pinky finger indicates sarcasm
					First thing they learn is “I have toh”
					What can we assume?
					It was developed initially to aid in combat, but Maidens took it the extra step to turn it into a more complex system
					Was it?  What are the audience thoughts?
					Fingerspelling is probably phonetic rather than alphabetical
					Do Maidens do a lot of reading?
					Preference for one-handed signs
					They have to hold weapons in the other often
					Slow, steady pace to prevent excess noise from clapping, snapping etc
					American Sign Language Lesson
					Grammar 
					Time + topic + comment
					Adjectives often come after the noun 
					Shield maiden words
					Run, walk, eat, drink, water, shade, honor, obligation, servant, war, fight, sister,</p>
